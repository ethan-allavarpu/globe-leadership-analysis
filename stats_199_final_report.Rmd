# Abstract

In this paper, I plan to discuss two main aspects of drafting a fantasy football team. In the first section, I consider the variability present within starter-quality players for each of the main offensive positions--quarterback (QB), running back (RB), wide receiver (WR), and tight end (TE)--to determine if there is an inherent strategy at play regarding which position to prioritize. In the second portion, I develop a predictive model to decide a player's potential success regarding fantasy football points based on his statistics from the prior year. For both the analysis and the models, I consider fantasy football leagues that utilize ESPN PPR (point per reception) scoring rules in a 12-team format with the following offensive lineup: 1 QB, 2 RB, 2 WR, 1 TE, and 1 flex position, which can be an additional RB, WR, or TE. In this paper, though, I will omit the influence of the flex position to consider the four positions independently for model building.

# Introduction

Fantasy football captivates many sports fans each season. Whether it is daily fantasy or a season-long commitment, managers search for the best players to acquire for their teams in the upcoming NFL season. A variety of different scoring methods exist--from standard to PPR to custom scoring methodologies. While this analysis can be easily adapted to any scoring system, I will limit it to PPR scoring since this tends to be the most common form seen across platforms.

PPR scoring[^1] is an add-on scoring system to the standard scoring system[^2] with the singular difference being that players receive an additional point for each reception made throughout the season, placing additional weight on the RB, TE, and WR positions.

# Data Collection

I took most of my data from Pro Football Reference[^10]. I gathered .csv files on the performance of NFL players--including statistics as well as fantasy points scored--from the 2010 to 2020 NFL seasons. I chose the 11 most recent seasons because football continuously evolves season after season, so the most recent seasons will look the most similar to the 2021 NFL season, for which I am trying to predict player success. Even 11 seasons is a bit of a stretch--the game in 2019 looked markedly different from that in 2012, but I required the 10 data groupings from 11 seasons due to a need for adequate sample sizes.

[^10]: Pro Football Reference: https://www.pro-football-reference.com/

To decide a cutoff for players to include in my analysis, I utilized the influence of the starting lineup slots as defined in the abstract (1 QB, 2 RB, 2 WR, 1 TE, 1 flex). Now, the flex position is a bit variable (i.e., managers often use bench players with the best matchup), so for determining which players to use, I ignored the influence of the flex spot. This led me to include one player for each opening on a roster, plus an additional player for each position in a bench role. So, when accounting for a 12-team league, I limited the players in my data set to players with the following position rank (i.e., their PPR score rank among players at the same position) in the prior season: top 24 (12 + 12) for QB and TE, and top 36 (24 + 12) for RB and WR. This cutoff existed for both *next year's scores* and *this year's data* to remove players that may have been injured or "fell off a cliff" (i.e., dropped drastically in production): such players would be outliers that would skew my predictions. 

While parsing through the data, I encountered a few edge cases which I had to address. Some players had the same name, making player-matching a little difficult. For this analysis, I only included the "best" player with a given name, as it is improbable that there are two high-end players with the same name.

Additionally, some features had `NA` values for a few observations, which I addressed based on context:

  - For rush yards per attempt (YPA) and receiving yards per catch (YPC), the `NA` values likely resulted from $\frac{0 \text{ yards}}{0 \text{ attempts}}$ or $\frac{0 \text{ yards}}{0 \text{ catches}}$, respectively; for my analyses, I set these instances to 0.
  - For `two_pt_made`, `two_pt_pass`, and `fmb_lst` (i.e., two-point conversions (rush/receive), two-point conversions (pass), and fumbles lost), `NA` values likely result from 0 two-point attempts or 0 fumbles, respectively, so it would be useless to add values in these observations. Therefore, I have chosen to assign a value of 0 to the instances of `NA` for these two variables.
  - VBD and the overall rank for some players is `NA`. However, these statistics are calculated using standard scoring, *not* PPR; therefore, for my analysis, I have chosen to remove these two features for subsequent analyses.

# Variability by Positions

After cleaning the data appropriately, I wished to look at the variability by position to determine if there is a position which managers should draft first in their leagues. While my second section will help to determine the best players at each position, this part serves to tell us if there is a certain position that should be drafted before the others. In a draft, managers have to prioritize which positions to fill first when constructing their rosters, so finding the most variable positions can tell us which positions have the largest drop in performance.

Most managers follow the tenet that they should draft running backs and wide receivers earlier than quarterbacks and tight ends because those two positions are perceived as the "most volatile" (i.e., they have the greatest variance in scores for a given season). Therefore, I have included this section to determine if there is any merit to this belief. Before conducting significance tests, though, I first wanted to visualize the data to see if there were any interesting patterns regarding the spread of the data.

```{r, fig.height = 5}
col_scheme <- rgb(c(0, 0.5, 0, 0), c(0, 0, 0.5, 0), c(0, 0, 0, 0.5), alpha = 0.5)
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
for (i in seq_along(pos_ff_pts)) {
  hist(pos_ff_pts[[i]]$ppr, breaks = 9, col = col_scheme[i],
       main = paste("PPR Fantasy Points for ", names(pos_ff_pts)[i], sep = ""),
       xlab = paste("Position: ", names(pos_ff_pts)[i], sep = ""),
       xlim = range(ff_train$ppr) + c(-100, 100), cex.axis = 0.75,
       las = 1, freq = FALSE)
}
```

The above histograms demonstrate the right-skewed nature of PPR scores. Most players will hover around a central point, with a few elite players pushing the boundary and truly separating themselves from the pack. While I can see that--since the x-axis of each histogram is on the same scale--the difference in the spread does not seem too drastic between positions, I will need further investigation, which is why I chose to incorporate side-by-side boxplots as well.

```{r}
pos_plots <- boxplot(ppr ~ position, data = ff_train,
        col = col_scheme[1:4], main = "Boxplot of Points by Position",
        xlab = "Position", ylab = "PPR", las = 1, cex.axis = 0.75)
```

```{r}
iqr_vals <- pos_plots$stats[c(2, 4), ]
colnames(iqr_vals) <- c("QB", "RB", "TE", "WR")
rownames(iqr_vals) <- c("Q1", "Q3")
iqrs <- iqr_vals[2, ] - iqr_vals[1, ]
iqr_vals <- data.frame(rbind(iqr_vals, "IQR" = iqrs))
kable(iqr_vals, caption = "PPR Quartiles by Position")
```


The boxplots above seem to agree with the histograms. While the range for each position seems different (in particular, the TE position seems to have a smaller range than the others), the interquartile ranges are all roughly equal, seeming to suggest that no position should take precedence over the others. To confirm these findings, I will consider using Levene's test to test for equal variance.

```{r}
small_df <- rbind(start_ff_train,
                  start_ff_validation) %>% dplyr::select(ppr, position)
equal_var <- leveneTest(ppr ~ position, data = small_df)
p_val <- equal_var$`Pr(>F)`[1]
kable(equal_var, caption = "Levene's Test for Homogeneity of Variance")
```

The p-value for Levene's test is `r round(p_val, 4)`; since this is greater than the standard significance threshold of $\alpha = 0.05$, I fail to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, I do not have evidence of different variances between the groups, suggesting that, when filling out my roster, I should go by the projected fantasy points alone (until a position is filled) rather than placing preference on certain positions (as many managers traditionally do with RB and WR). This is not the only viable draft strategy, though; one other method could be to see which player has the largest difference over the next best available player at a given position (since the variability could very well be the same across all four groups). Again, the purpose of this part of my paper was to show a difference (or lack thereof) in the variances of the four positions, *not* to promote or support a specific draft mindset.

# Predicting Future Results
## Constructing the Models
To predict next season's fantasy success for each player, I divided my data set into four categories by position (QB, RB, WR, TE), developing a separate model for each. In each instance, I created a training set and a validation set by randomly selecting three years (out of ten) to be combined into a single validation set, while the other seven were treated as my training set. After developing the best model for each position, I used it to predict next year's fantasy football points for each player in my test data set.

When predicting future fantasy football success, I ran into a minor limitation at the start of my model construction: a lack of variables. To address this issue, I created a few variables that I believed would display weekly success, such as passing, rushing, and receiving yards *per game* for each position. I added these variables to help demonstrate high-quality production each week to complement the consistency shown by cumulative yearly totals. In addition to these elements, I incorporated a completion percentage variable ($\frac{\text{completions}}{\text{attempts}}$) for the quarterback that demonstrates how accurate a quarterback was during a given season. After incorporating these additional transformations, I considered my background in football. Inherently, players tend to cluster together into tiers depending on ability (e.g., elite, good, average) and play style (run-first, pass-first). Therefore, to account for these differences--and thus create a model that has slightly different weights for each group--I performed K-means clustering to divide the training set into clusters. I did not have a specific number of clusters in mind; rather, I performed clustering using 2 to 25 clusters and made a judgment regarding when the between-cluster sum of squares "leveled off" (i.e., there was not a drastic improvement after adding another cluster).

After adding the additional variables and features, I constructed a variety of models for predictions, using validation mean-squared error (MSE) in conjunction with plots comparing the validation set predictions to the validation observed values--essentially a residual plot, but for the validation set instead of the training set--to search for the model which provides the best accuracy[^3]. Throughout the process, I considered both different models as well as different transformations: I looked at simple linear regression, multivariate linear regression, bagging models, ridge regression, LASSO, and SVM (support vector machines) for regression to see the best model. I also considered log transformations of both the predictor as well as response variables to better fit a potential non-linear relationship.

[^3]: While the lowest MSE is ideal, there are a few instances in which I pick a model that does *not* have the lowest MSE. I did this because, as will be explained later, sometimes it is better to have a slightly worse MSE if the model more than offsets the worse MSE with an increase in interpretability and simplicity.

One thing I considered at the outset was if my model could perform better than a traditional default of predicting next year's fantasy football points purely on this year's; this was the first model I constructed as my "simple linear model": univariate and likely how most people would consider picking certain players. As explained below, the models constructed for each position had varying degrees of complexity and interpretability; some were close to the basic linear model I mentioned, others were too complicated for simple inference on the predictor variables. 

Before I delve into the final candidate model for each respective position, I would like to acknowledge the difficulty in predicting sports statistics (of which fantasy football scores are an extension) due to the random factors in sports. While sports analytics have come a long way in terms of predictive accuracy, it is the unpredictable which makes sports fascinating to watch and keeps viewers and fans entertained.

## Final Models
### QB
For the quarterback position, the best model in terms of MSE was the multivariate linear model (MSE of 2657.062), but I chose to use a LASSO model (MSE of 2879.755) after a log transformation on the response variable. The reason for my decision is that while the linear model performed better on the validation data, I was worried that including too many variables in a model, especially when the model is additive, could lead to overfitting; in turn, this would make my model too dependent on the specific data I had. 

```{r}
beta_mat <- as.matrix(qb_best$beta)
colnames(beta_mat) <- qb_best$lambda
plot(obs - val_preds ~ val_preds, data = useful_qb_data,
     main = "Observed - Predicted for QB Validation Set",
     xlab = "Predicted PPR", ylab = "Observed - Predicted",
     col = col_scheme[1], pch = 19, las = 1, cex.axis = 0.75)
```

Based on the above plot, it seems like there might be a slight trend in my validation predictions which indicates that I may potentially be missing variable in my model, but on the whole, the plot seems alright (and thus generally valid and useful for predictions). With this final model, therefore, the only included variables are pass yards and the prior year's PPR score:

$$
\hat{\log(y)}= `r beta_mat[, qb_best$lambda == qb_lambda][beta_mat[, qb_best$lambda == qb_lambda] > 0][1]`(\text{pass yards}) + `r beta_mat[, qb_best$lambda == qb_lambda][beta_mat[, qb_best$lambda == qb_lambda] > 0][2]`(\text{PPR})
$$
$$
\hat{y}= e^{`r beta_mat[, qb_best$lambda == qb_lambda][beta_mat[, qb_best$lambda == qb_lambda] > 0][1]`(\text{pass yards}) + `r beta_mat[, qb_best$lambda == qb_lambda][beta_mat[, qb_best$lambda == qb_lambda] > 0][2]`(\text{PPR})}
$$

From this model, we can see that, realistically, only two main factors need to be considered for next year's predictions for quarterbacks: their passing yardage total and how many PPR points they scored last year. While these two predictors are not independent (PPR is a linear combination of a variety of other variables), we see that we don't need much more than the basic statistics for a quarterback to predict his future success.

Contextually, quarterbacks do not receive as many points for a touchdown pass (4) as running backs and receivers do for a rushing or receiving touchdown (6), so the yardage total proves more important for quarterbacks than other positions. On the whole, this also suggests that passing yards are a more dependable method of fantasy points than touchdowns, which fit with my prior conception that predictions would more likely be based on variables that are easier to keep at a consistent level over time.

Utilizing this model, I predicted the outcomes for next year's fantasy football leaders based on their results from the 2020 NFL Season:

```{r}
final_qb <- read.csv("qb_predictions.csv")[, 2:3]
kable(head(final_qb, 10), caption = "QB Predictions for the 2021 NFL Season")
```

There are not many surprises in the top 10 for this list, but one major omission would be Lamar Jackson, who has become an elite fantasy quarterback. Lamar Jackson was sidelined by COVID-19 during a few games last season, so he was not able to have the full impact he normally does. However, this could also indicate a shift toward a decline in his production, as his running game may not be as sustainable at the quarterback position.

### RB
For running backs, the best model in terms of MSE was the bagging model after a log transformation on the response variable (5092.749). The interpretability of a model like this is difficult to assess, which was one drawback of using a bagging model. Before delving into the interpretation for predictor variables, I first had to ensure little-to-no trend in the plot of `observed - expected` for the validation data. 

```{r}
colnames(rb_useful_data)[1] <- "val_preds"
plot(obs - val_preds ~ val_preds, data = rb_useful_data,
     main = "Observed - Predicted for RB Validation Set",
     xlab = "Predicted PPR", ylab = "Observed - Predicted",
     col = col_scheme[2], pch = 19, las = 1, cex.axis = 0.75)
```

There is not much of a trend in the residuals for the bagging model, indicating that we should be alright to use it for predictions. With this model, I looked at a variable importance plot with the percent increase in MSE criterion to determine the most influential variables:

```{r}
varImpPlot(rb_best, n.var = 10, type = 1,
           pch = 19, col = col_scheme[2], cex = 0.75,
           main = "Important Predictors for RB Success")
```

From the above plot, it appears that the most influential feature is the number of games played. This makes sense, as the more games a player played, the better health he likely has, implying better performance in the following season. We also see that rushing yards, like passing yards for quarterbacks, have importance in determining success in the following season. It is interesting to note that receiving touchdowns carry more importance than rushing touchdowns. This reflects the transition from a pure running back to an all-purpose back: in today's NFL, running backs need to be versatile and adaptable--they need to be able to catch the ball and play a role in the passing game in addition to toting the rock.

Taking these factors into account, here are the predictions for next season's running backs:

```{r}
final_rb <- read.csv("rb_predictions.csv")[, 2:3]
kable(head(final_rb, 10), caption = "RB Predictions for the 2021 NFL Season")
```
Again, it is interesting to note the absence of three running backs on this list: Ezekiel Elliot, Saquon Barkley, and Christian McCaffrey. All three running backs, who are elite in today's game by most measures, suffered injury-plagued seasons, leaving my model unable to predict their scores next season adequately. This list, though, does contain new, up-and-coming running backs, potentially demonstrating the short shelf life of running backs; running backs do not stay at an elite level for a long time in the NFL.


### TE

The tight end position ended up having a base model similar to that of the quarterback: I chose the LASSO model, except without any transformation to the response variable (MSE of 1219.308). While the LASSO model post-transformation had a lower MSE (1204.194), I did not find the difference drastic enough to warrant its usage; if two models have a similar MSE, the simpler model is likely better (to avoid overfitting). When considering a plot of predicted and observed values from the validation data set, we see that the model appears to account for most of the *trend* in the data.

```{r}
colnames(te_useful_data)[1] <- "val_preds"
plot(obs - val_preds ~ val_preds, data = te_useful_data,
     main = "Observed - Predicted for TE Validation Set",
     xlab = "Predicted PPR", ylab = "Observed - Predicted",
     col = col_scheme[3], pch = 19, las = 1, cex.axis = 0.75)
```

However, there does appear to be one small issue with the LASSO model: the outlier near the bottom of the plot, as I overpredicted fantasy points by more than one hundred. When looking further into this observation, I noticed that this observation is for Jordan Cameron of the Cleveland Browns in 2013 and his subsequent disappointing 2014 season. In the 2014 season, Cameron was plagued by concussion injuries, leaving him sidelined for multiple games and providing a reason for his disappointing performance as depicted on the graph. Once again, my model--nor any model I know--can predict injuries with a high success rate, so this outlier is alright when predicting PPR points.

An interesting aspect of this model is its simplicity: for all the various models I considered, the model created by LASSO simplified to a univariate model: this time, though, the variable of choice was receiving yards (instead of PPR, as was the case for my initial simple linear model):

```{r}
beta_mat <- as.matrix(te_best$beta)
colnames(beta_mat) <- te_best$lambda
```

$$
\hat{y}= `r beta_mat[, te_best$lambda == te_lambda][beta_mat[, te_best$lambda == te_lambda]>0]`(\text{receiving yards})
$$

Similar to the situation for the quarterback position, yardage totals are a more reliable demonstration of a player's consistency than touchdowns, so it makes sense that the model chose to emphasize that statistic. Players with more receiving yards likely receive more targets and receptions as well, placing themselves as volume options within a given offense, as highlighted by the predictions for TEs next year:

```{r}
final_te <- read.csv("te_predictions.csv")[, 2:3]
kable(head(final_te, 10), caption = "TE Predictions for the 2021 NFL Season")
```
The interesting part of these predictions occurs at slots *(1)*, *(2)*, and *(5)*. Travis Kelce and Darren Waller are predicted to *massively* outclass their fellow tight ends, placing themselves as a viable option for early-round picks (they appear to be *significantly better* than the rest of the pack). I also highlighted George Kittle because Kittle missed *a lot* of games this season with injuries, yet is still predicted to be fifth (in the middle of the pack). Intuitively, I think that had Kittle played a complete season, his prediction for the 2021 NFL season would be on par with Waller and Kelce, in a higher echelon than other tight ends. Outside of the top 2 (and Kittle, had he played a full season), there appears to be very little separating the tight ends from one another.


### WR

Of the nine models I considered for the wide receiver position, the best model was a ridge regression model after a response variable transformation (i.e., transforming $y$ into $\log(y)$ before running the ridge regression algorithm); it had the lowest MSE of all potential candidate models (2279.374). 

```{r}
colnames(useful_wr_data)[1] <- "val_preds"
plot(obs - val_preds ~ val_preds, data = useful_wr_data,
     main = "Observed - Predicted for WR Validation Set",
     xlab = "Predicted PPR", ylab = "Observed - Predicted",
     col = col_scheme[4], pch = 19, las = 1, cex.axis = 0.75)
```

The above plot shows that there appear to slight issues with the model. It seems to underpredict values at the extreme ends, with increased variability for the middle data points. However, these are slight deviations, so on the whole the model seems justified for use.

This method--ridge regression--shrinks the coefficients of all included predictors toward 0 similar to LASSO; however, unlike LASSO, it never sets any predictors to exactly 0. This means that all predictors input into the model initially will remain in the model after the best lambda ($\lambda$) value is chosen; the relative size of each coefficient, rather than just its presence, will denote the variable's importance. Below, the coefficients may seem small; this is because of the log transformation to the response. Regardless, at the moment we are more interested in the relative value of these coefficients: larger magnitudes indicate greater impact for a given variable, with positive coefficients showing those variables had a positive relationship (i.e., an increase in these variables has a positive effect on the response), while negative coefficients meant that as the value of that variable increased, the response variable decreased.

```{r}
beta_mat <- as.matrix(wr_best$beta)
colnames(beta_mat) <- wr_best$lambda
betas <- beta_mat[, wr_best$lambda == wr_lambda]
betas <- betas[order(abs(betas), decreasing = TRUE)]
betas <- data.frame(Statistic = names(betas), Coefficient = betas)
rownames(betas) <- NULL
betas$Statistic[2] <- "yds_per_rush"
betas$Statistic[8] <- "yds_per_rec"
kable(head(betas, 10), caption = "Top Coefficients for WR Predictions")
barplot(betas$Coefficient, ylim = c(-0.002, 0.008),
        main = "Coefficients for Each WR Variable",
        col = col_scheme[4], names.arg = betas$Statistic,
        cex.names = 0.5, las = 2, cex.axis = 0.75)
abline(h = 0)
```

\pagebreak

Of the six most influential variables, five seem to make sense, regarding both size and sign. More receiving yards, receptions, and PPR points tend to indicate higher levels of dependable future success, while more targets and older age indicate a decrease in production.[^5] The one surprising statistic that found its way into the mix was yards per rush attempt: this statistic does not typically affect wide receivers, as they rarely run the ball; this might indicate, though, a potential increase in the usage of wide receivers in the offense through plays like the jet sweep. However, this could also be the result of a confounding variable which I have omitted in my analysis, as there might also be a link between how often a wide receiver runs the ball and a third variable that explains the increase in PPR scores.

[^5]: Targets and receptions are correlated, so if a player gets more receptions *and* targets, there is a net-positive impact (since receptions have a greater impact). However, if a player has more targets but is unable to convert those targets into receptions, he will be seen as a less reliable player and thus less likely to succeed in the following season.

```{r}
final_wr <- read.csv("wr_predictions.csv")[, 2:3]
kable(head(final_wr, 10), caption = "WR Predictions for the 2021 NFL Season")
```

For the wide receivers, there are no great surprises, as the players on this list are young and valuable assets to their respective teams. Similar to the running back position, there is the absence of two great players--Julio Jones and Michael Thomas--who both struggled with injuries during the 2020 season. Nonetheless, similar to the running back predictions, many of the players on this top 10 list are young and athletic players whose physical talents allow them to perform to their full potential

## Conclusion

After constructing the four primary models, I wanted to see how they compared to one another. To do this, I decided to look at the difference in what was considered "the best MSE" (i.e., the lowest MSE of the possible models) for each model; I noticed that it varied by position. The quarterback models hovered around 3000, running backs around 5500, wide receivers around 2500, and tight ends around 1300. Intuitively, this might indicate that the running back position is the "least predictable," but we have to consider the total variation present in the data set (i.e., the mean squared deviations of the validation set)[^4]. Therefore, a better way to assess the "strength" of each model would be to look at the models as a ratio with the mean squared deviations.

```{r}
qb_ratio <- qb_mses[8] / qb_val_mse
rb_ratio <- rb_mses[8] / rb_val_mse
te_ratio <- te_mses[4] / te_val_mse
wr_ratio <- wr_mses[9] / wr_val_mse
ratios <- data.frame(Position = c("QB", "RB", "TE", "WR"), Ratio = c(qb_ratio, rb_ratio, te_ratio, wr_ratio))
kable(ratios, row.names = FALSE, caption = "Ratio of Model MSE to Mean Squared Deviations")
```

When predicting the actual score for each quarterback next season, the "best" model performs *worse* than if we simply predicted the mean for each player (since the ratio is greater than 1). However, we have to consider two things: *(1)* we do not know next year's average PPR scores--so that is a futile exercise--and *(2)* the goal of this analysis is not only to predict absolute predictions for each player but also his performance *relative to his peers*. Therefore, if we simply predicted the mean for each player, we would be unable to see which players would perform better than their counterparts (and by how much).

Another thing to take into account is that the RB position, which had the highest absolute validation MSE, was the second-best model regarding relative MSE (after the tight end position). This shows us that, for our validation data set, there tended to be more variability at the running back position *for the given set of players*[^4], which is why we saw higher MSE values at the running back position in the models.

Relative to the squared deviations of the validation set, we can see that the tight end model performed best. One potential explanation would be that the tight end position, in general, tends to be a "high floor, low ceiling" position, which means that the players perform at a relatively consistent level, but there isn't much explosion/unpredictability when compared to the other three positions.  

[^4]: While the validation data set's mean squared deviations do vary by position, this variation is not statistically significant: in the earlier part, we failed to reject the null hypothesis that the variability for PPR scores was different for the positions.

Again, while the ideal model minimizes the MSE, our main goal was to predict the position of players relative to others at the same position; therefore, predictions matter in that they show us how well a certain player will perform relative to the others (i.e., a ranking). So, after seeing the predictions for the four positions, we will construct the "best lineup." We will ignore the flex position--it requires a comparison between positions, which will be discussed below in the "Further Analysis" section--so the best lineup would include the top QB, top two RB, two best WR, and best TE for a total of six players. In addition to the starting lineup, I have included a backup of one player for each position (which corresponds to the second-best QB and TE and the third-best RB and WR).

```{r}
final_lineup <- rbind(final_qb[1, ], final_rb[1:2, ], final_te[1, ], final_wr[1:2, ])
names(final_lineup)[1] <- "Starter"
final_lineup <- cbind(Position = c("QB", "RB1", "RB2", "TE", "WR1", "WR2"), final_lineup)
bench <- rbind(final_qb[2, ], final_rb[3, ], final_te[2, ], final_wr[3, ])
b_team <- bench[, 1]
b_team <- c(b_team[1:2], "", b_team[3:4], "")
team <- cbind(final_lineup, Backup = b_team)
kable(team[, c(1:2, 4)], row.names = FALSE, caption = "Best Potential Team")
```


The above table is an ideal scenario, as it is extremely unlikely--if not impossible--for a manager in a twelve-team league to snag all of these players. Instead, managers have to choose players based on who is still available at the time of their pick.[^12] Returning to a statement I made earlier in this paper, there are many ways to prioritize a position. I prefer the method of the "drop off"--seeing which position has the largest difference between the top two available players and drafting at that specified position--but this is a subjective approach not backed by statistical analysis. One statistically-supported claim I can make, though, is that the typical strategy of prioritizing running backs and wide receivers solely because they possess more variability than quarterbacks and tight ends is not entirely founded in statistics; I have shown that the variability present is statistically insignificant.

# Further Analysis

While I have performed a strong amount of analysis, there still exist some gaps in my analysis that could, if implemented, demonstrate improvement and expansion on a well-defined model.

In my predictive analysis, I considered a player's performance in the prior season to predict his performance in the subsequent season. While this style of analysis accounts for most of the variability, it does not account for sustained performance over time. This issue becomes prevalent when a strong player suffers an injury that leaves him sidelined for most of (or the entirety of) the season (such as Christian McCaffrey or Saquon Barkley during the 2020 NFL season), leaving little to no data for the next season. However, intuition tells us that these players would likely play well next season. In subsequent analyses, I would consider some aspect of time-series analysis  *(1)* to account for season-by-season improvement and *(2)* to help lessen the impact of an injury in a given season.

A player's performance is not only affected by injuries, but also by the team for which that player plays. There are interactions between the players on offensive-minded teams--for example, the Kansas City Chiefs would have players that built on one another's successes--and switching teams via free agency--a new player would have less chemistry with the rest of the team and, in turn, less likely to perform at the same level as he did on his former team.

Another instance in which predictions become impossible with my model is for incoming rookies (first-year NFL players). These players may have played exceptionally in college, but it is difficult to account for a potential drop off in performance as a result of a new league as well as stronger competition, which is why I based my predictions on prior performance *in the NFL*. Unfortunately, as a result of this decision, I cannot predict the performance of rookies for the upcoming seasons. To resolve this issue, one thing I may consider in the future is to establish a separate model for first-year players that would be based on their pre-NFL statistics, such as college performance and the NFL Combine. However, I found this unsuitable for predicting fantasy football success in general because I would have two separate models--one for continuing players and another for rookies--which would create conflicts when trying to merge predictions, which already was an issue with my four separate models by position.

I could also attempt to combine all four positional models into a single predictive method. By combining the models, I would be able to more accurately assess the relationship between positions and predictions. In its current state, my analysis establishes four models, providing a ranking for each position, but the potential bias and variance differ for each position--my model may overpredict for WR, but underpredict for RB. Therefore, making comparisons between these two groups would be inadequate, as simply combining the predictions would result in heavy favoring of the wide receiver position in this hypothetical scenario.

The reason why I did not consider that approach for my research in this paper is because I wanted to delineate between each position. I believe that, inherently, the four groups were distinct enough that each would be modeled best with an individual model. While I could have considered a dummy variable for the position of each player, I feel as if it might have been masked by the other variables present in the data set. I could have also considered interactions between position and the other variables, but it could have become complicated very quickly and likely would have resulted in a similar model to the four individual models, which would have the same result.

Lastly, there are a few positions that I did not consider in my analysis which I might consider in follow-up analyses. There is the issue of the flex position--a potential choice between RB, WR, and TE--which could be solved if I found a way to combine the four individual models to predict similar outcomes for each position. In its current state, my models seem to favor the wide receiver position, which would indicate that managers should look to select wide receivers to fill their flex position to maximize the points they can get from a lineup.

There are also two other "positions" in a fantasy football lineup: team defense (D/ST) and a kicker (K). I didn't consider these positions because they have less of an impact on a manager's success than the four core positions (and, as such, managers tend to choose these positions in the last two-three rounds of a fantasy football draft). I could dive deeper for another analysis, but I found it insignificant to the main question I hoped to answer, so I omitted these positions for this paper.

\section{Abstract}\label{abstract}}

Our team wanted to answer two main questions: which leadership qualities
do countries tend to view similarly and if countries align their
perceptions of societal practices and values. For determining leadership
qualities and similar countries, we used principal component analysis
(PCA) then \(k\)-means clustering to create four ``clusters'' of
countries with similar leadership beliefs. For determining the alignment
of perceptions of societal practices and values, we used linear
regression models for each pair. Then, we performed t-tests for each
dimension to check for significant slopes. We found that leadership
characteristics are generally clustered by whether the trait is negative
or positive and by geological region, except for one interesting case.
For the second question, we shockingly discovered that societal
practices and societal values of countries do not align and are instead
opposing. In the future, we recommend looking into causes behind the
interesting disconnect between practices and values. Some limitations to
our project are the data silences due to the lack of information from
many countries.

\section{Description of Dataset}\label{description-of-dataset}}

The dataset we have chosen to analyze is the \textbf{Dana Landis
Leadership} dataset, which comes from the GLOBE Research Survey. The
data provided in the folder had survey results for (1) leadership and
(2) societal and culture data and a PDF describing the nature of the
survey, but nothing more. To glean more information, we found the two
questionnaires (alpha and beta) described in the informational PDF to
get the original questions asked in the surveys. While we do not have a
``codebook'' in a traditional sense, the original questions asked may
help guide us in understanding what each variable means and how the
survey represents respondents answers numerically. The survey is on a 1
to 7 scale. For the leadership data, 1 was a negative response, 4 a
``neutral'' score, and 7 positive. For the societal data, the
``positive'' and ``negative'' values depended on the question, but for
the relationships we analyzed, this did not impact our results.

The GLOBE (Global Leadership \& Organizational Behavior Effectiveness)
research program is an interdisciplinary study aiming to identify the
interrelationships between societal culture, societal effectiveness and
organizational leadership. Surveying from over 17,000 middle managers
from 62 cultures, the 2004 research survey provides data that measures
the leadership and societal culture practices of each country (House et
al, 2004).

A single, complete observation from the leadership survey is for a
specific culture (either a country or a subcountry) and has 30
variables: one for the country, one for the country name, one for the
country cluster, and then 27 other variables about leadership qualities
(e.g., Face saver; Participative Global Leadership Dimension;
Participative).

A single, complete observation from the society and culture survey has a
similar structure as the leadership survey--each observation is for a
specific culture (either a country or a subcountry) and has 21
variables: one for the country, one for the country name, one for the
country cluster, and then 18 other variables about society and culture
qualities (e.g., Assertiveness Societal Practices; Future Orientation
Societal Values; Human Orientation Societal Values).

The map in Figure 1 shows autocratic levels by country. The lighter
colors correspond to lower levels of autocracy while the darker colors
correspond to higher levels of autocracy. For example, we see that
Russia, a well-known autocratic country, is shaded darkly. Notably,
there appears to be clusters of autocratic countries in the East and
clusters of less autocratic countries in the West. The East is known for
being more collectivist while the West is known for being more
individualistic. As we delve into later, beliefs and cultures do seem to
vary by region.

From boxplots we generated (not pictured), the difference by country
cluster (as defined by the dataset) seems visible, prompting us to
consider clustering countries to determine how they may be separated. We
do want to note that there are only 62 observations--this totals to
fewer than 62 countries because Germany and South Africa have two
observations each (West vs.~East and White vs.~Black, respecively). The
limited number of observations may limit the scope of our analysis
because we have less than a third of the total countries (demonstrated
by the vast swaths of grey on the world map for which there is no data)
and clustering would further reduce block/group sizes.

\subsection{Societal Values and
Practices}\label{societal-values-and-practices}}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{globe_report_files/figure-latex/society-1} \end{center}

The plot grid in Figure 2 demonstrates how, contrary to what we might
expect, the societal values of a country do not align well with the
societal practices (what \emph{should be} does not align with what
\emph{is}). This may be a source of further exploration, as we may want
to see whether there is a significant misalignment between the values
and practices. When we look at the per-region divisions though (by
color), the trend (or lack thereof) seems to persist for these concepts.

\hypertarget{analysis}{%
\section{Analysis}\label{analysis}}

\hypertarget{leadership-values}{%
\subsection{Leadership Values}\label{leadership-values}}

For the leadership values problem statement, the first objective is to
collapse the data into the major principal components through principal
component analysis (PCA). PCA finds the directions which capture the
most variability (spread) in the data and allows us to visualize trends
in the leadership values: countries tend to have similar sentiments
about variables that ``point'' in the same direction (had principal
component values that aligned).

Before performing PCA, though, we remove the second-order factor
analysis variables due to the heavy correlation with the original
predictor variables and a more difficult interpretation of these
variables. Since our goal is to understand the relationship between
certain leadership characteristics, keeping these complicated variables
might reduce our understanding and make interpretation more difficult.

After performing PCA, we keep the first four principle components that
account for 80\% of all data variations, and perform \(k\)-means
clustering to determine the ``groups'' of leadership characteristics
that have similar perceptions. \(K\)-means clustering creates \(k\)
groups that are the ``most similar'' to the other observations in their
groups, minimizing the between-group variability:

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{globe_report_files/figure-latex/pca_heatmap-1} \end{center}

\definecolor{clust3}{HTML}{408000}

\tightlist

  \textcolor{clust1}{Internally competitive, malevolent, status conscious, self-centred, bureaucratic, face saver, autocratic}
\item
  \textcolor{clust2}{Humane-oriented, modesty}
\item
  \textcolor{clust3}{Participative, team integrator, inspirational, autonomous, administratively competent, integrity, visionary, diplomatic, decisive, collaborative team orientation, self-sacrifice, performance-oriented}
\end{enumerate}

The green cluster seems to describe positive characteristics (e.g.,
participative, inspirational), while the blue cluster appears to
describe negative characteristics (e.g., malevolent, self-centered).
From this, we note that these ``positive'' and ``negative''
characteristics tend to occur together. The third ``cluster'' (i.e.,
humane oriented and modesty) did not closely fit with the other groups,
leading us to believe that they may be considered separately from the
other characteristics.

After considering the leadership characteristics, we cluster countries
based on similar perceptions. We do this by using the variables of the
countries transformed into the first four principal components, then
running \(k\)-means clustering on those components. The clustering
results segregate the countries into the following segments:

\emph{Note: East and West Germany belong to the same cluster and are
colored as such. South Africa is colored by the cluster the Black sample
belongs in, rather than the White sample. Countries that are not
included in the data are colored gray.}

From the above grouping, we see that regionality (generally) determines
a country's respective cluster and leadership perspectives. Cluster 1
(light blue) tends to describe Latin American and the Mediterranean,
Cluster 2 (dark blue) generally includes Asia, and Cluster 4 (gold)
describes the Anglo regions and northern Europe. The one cluster that
appears to be ``out there'' is Cluster 3 (green), which does not have a
particular region associated with it. To visualize the differences
between these clusters, we create a heatmap of the median variable
values for each cluster:

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{globe_report_files/figure-latex/cluster_values-1} \end{center}

From here, we see that, despite the clustering, the countries tend to
agree on beneficial and detrimental leadership qualities; the main
difference is in the intensity: clusters 1 and 4 seem to have the
strongest responses (most positive and most negative), while cluster 3
does not seem to feel terribly strongly about positive leadership
characteristics. The few qualities of intrigue, though, are the ones for
which some clusters viewed positively (green) while others viewed
negatively (red):

  Status Conscious

\hypertarget{societal-practices-and-values}{%
\subsection{Societal Practices and
Values}\label{societal-practices-and-values}}

From the scatterplots in Figure 2, we note that societal practices and
societal values do not always align. For instance, in the case of the
Humane Orientation cultural dimension, there does not appear to be any
correlation between practices and values at all, with societal practices
in this dimension varying from less than 3.5 to more than 5.0 on the
survey's seven-point scale even though societal values were rated
relatively similarly across all of the surveyed countries. In some other
cases, such as for the Uncertainty Avoidance cultural dimension, there
appears to be a negative correlation between practices and values, as
indicated by the general trend of scores for practices in this dimension
decreasing even as scores for values increase. This negative correlation
might suggest that, rather than aligning, societal practices and
societal values are in fact in conflict.

To quantify these observations, we fit simple linear regression models
for each of the nine cultural dimensions, using the societal values
rating as the predictor and the societal practices rating as the
response. In other words, we fit the model: \[
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x
\] Where \(x\) is the societal values rating and \(y\) is the societal
practices rating for each of the nine cultural dimensions. Additionally,
we performed \(t\)-tests for each dimension, to test the hypotheses
\(H_0: \beta_1 = 0\) and \(H_1: \beta_1 \ne 0\). For this, we employed
the \emph{Bonferroni correction} to change the significance threshold
from \(\alpha = 0.05\) to \(\alpha = \frac{0.05}{9} \approx 0.0056\)
since maintaining a significance level of \(\alpha = 0.05\) would
increase the experiment-wise error rate:
\(P(\text{Any False Positive}) = 1 - P(\text{No False Positives}) = 1 - 0.95^{9} \approx 0.3698\).
The table below shows the values of \(\beta_1\) that we obtained and the
corresponding p-values. Cultural dimensions for which the p-value is
lower than the corrected \(\alpha \approx 0.0056\) are indicated with
green shading.

\end{table}

As shown above, most of the \(\beta_1\) values obtained were negative,
including all four values that were significant at the
\(\alpha = 0.56\)\% significant level as calculated using the Bonferroni
correction. This means that, as the ratings for the societal values of a
cultural dimension increase, the ratings for the corresponding societal
practices actually decrease. In other words, rather than being aligned,
societal practices in fact run counter to societal values.

\hypertarget{conclusions}{%
\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}}

Leadership characteristics are largely clustered based on whether each
trait is negative or positive. For example, the traits malevolent and
self centered have similar ratings while the traits integrity and
inspiration also have similar ratings. Additionally, leadership values
tend to be clustered based on their geographic region. This suggests
countries within smaller distances of one another have similar more
related leadership perspectives.

Our findings indicate that the societal practices and societal values of
countries do not align and are instead opposing. Thus, we conclude that
a country's societal value does not entail the same practices being
practiced among its constituents. This analysis can be useful for
government officials trying to develop policies that promote cultural
values. If a country places a high value on uncertainty avoidance (the
desire to rely on social norms and procedures to avoid unpredictable
events), then the same country may undergo unexpected and unconventional
events in the future.

\hypertarget{suggestions-for-further-research}{%
\section{Suggestions for Further
Research}\label{suggestions-for-further-research}}

Regarding the leadership investigation, some further research we may
consider is investigating \emph{why} Cluster 3 differs so greatly from
the other three clusters. In Cluster 3 we have France, Qatar, Morocco,
and South Africa (Black Sample). Understanding why these countries are
so different may help us see if there is an underlying link. Similarly,
we may want to consider the differences between South Africa's Black and
White samples and Germany's East and West samples. Since the survey was
conducted in 2004, Apartheid and the Berlin Wall, respectively, may play
a role in any potential differences. Ultimately, the above two
suggestions relate to us considering the country's framework: looking at
other indices (such as a freedom index, government approval ratings, or
a happiness index) could shift us from an unsupervised learning
situation (just understanding relationships between variables) to a
model-building mindset in which we might determine which characteristics
seem to have associations with more freedom/approval/happiness.

For both leadership and the societal analyses, further research may
conduct additional surveys to look at the potential changes in ideology
and perspectives over time to understanding the changing dynamics at
both the national and global level. Researchers should also look into
the potential causes behind the inverse relationship between social
values and practices.

\hypertarget{limitations}{%
\section{Limitations}\label{limitations}}

In the dataset, there are only 62 countries observed, limiting the
significance of the analysis and the confidence we have in clustering
countries by geographical similarities. In addition, there is no
explanation as to why only certain countries were surveyed. We also
recognize that at the time of data collection, the Apartheid and the
Berlin Wall potentially played significant factors in the differing
valuations of social and leadership values for citizens in South Africa
and Germany, respectively. It is notable that East and West Germany are
split up and South Africa is also split up by race.

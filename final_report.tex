We wanted to answer two main questions: which leadership qualities do
countries tend to view similarly and if countries align their
perceptions societal practices and values. For determining leadership
qualities and similar countries, we used principal component analysis
(PCA) then \(k\)-means clustering to create four ``clusters'' of
countries with similar leadership beliefs. We used the \_\_\_\_ method
to \_\_\_\_. We found that \_\_\_\_. We also looked at \_\_\_\_\_. In
the future, we recommend looking into \_\_\_\_\_. Some limitations to
our project are \_\_\_\_\_\_.

\section{Description of Dataset}\label{description-of-dataset}}

The data set we have chosen to analyze is the \textbf{Dana Landis
Leadership} dataset, which comes from the GLOBE Research Survey. The
data provided in the folder had survey results for (1) leadership and
(2) societal and culture data and a PDF describing the nature of the
survey, but nothing more. To glean more information, we found the two
questionnaires (alpha and beta) described in the informational PDF to
get the original questions asked in the surveys. While we do not have a
``codebook'' in a traditional sense, the original questions asked may
help guide us in understanding what each variable means and how the
survey represents respondents answers numerically. The survey is on a 1
to 7 scale, with 1 being a negative response, 4 a ``neutral'' score, and
7 positive.

Here is a look at 6 full and complete observations from the leadership
survey:

For the leadership values problem statement, the first objective is to
collapse the data into the first four principal components through
principal component analysis (PCA). PCA finds the directions which
capture the most variability in the data, so the first four account for
the maximum variation. PCA allows us to visualize trends in the
leadership values: countries tend to have similar sentiments about
variables that ``point'' in the same direction (had principal component
values that aligned).

Before performing PCA, though, we remove the second-order factor
analysis variables due to the heavy correlation with the original
predictor variables and a more difficult interpretation of these
variables. Since our goal is to understand the relationship between
certain leadership characteristics, keeping these complicated variables
might reduce our understanding of some characteristics.

After performing PCA, we visualize the directions of the first two
principal components. We also perform \(k\)-means clustering on the
first four principal components to determine the ``groups'' of
leadership characteristics that have similar perceptions:

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{final_report_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-4-1} \end{center}

After considering the leadership characteristics, we cluster countries
based on similar perceptions. We do this by using the variables of the
countries transformed into the first four principal components, then
running PCA on those components. The clustering results segregate the
countries into the following segments:

\subsection{Societal Practices and
Values}\label{societal-practices-and-values}}

To determine whether societal practices and societal values align, we
first create scatterplots of societal values against societal practices
for each of the nine cultural dimensions:

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{final_report_files/figure-latex/SPV Plots-1} \end{center}

From the scatterplots above, we note that societal practices and
societal values do not always align. For instance, in the case of the
Humane Orientation cultural dimension, there does not appear to be any
correlation between practices and values at all, with societal practices
in this dimension varying from less than 3.5 to more than 5.0 on the
survey's seven-point scale even though societal values were rated
relatively similarly across all of the surveyed countries. In some other
cases, such as for the Uncertainty Avoidance cultural dimension, there
appears to be a negative correlation between practices and values, as
indicated by the general trend of scores for practices in this dimension
decreasing even as scores for values increase. This negative correlation
might suggest that, rather than aligning, societal practices and
societal values are in fact in conflict.

To quantify the observations we made from our scatterplots above, we fit
simple linear regression models for each of the nine cultural
dimensions, using the societal values rating as the predictor and the
societal practices rating as the response. In other words, we fit the
model:

\[
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x
\]

Where \(x\) is the societal values rating and \(y\) is the societal
practices rating for each of the nine cultural dimensions. Additionally,
we performed \(t\)-tests for each dimension, to test the hypotheses
\(H_0: \beta_1 = 0\) and \(H_1: \beta_1 \ne 0\). For this, we employed
the \emph{Bonferroni correction} to change the significance threshold
from \(\alpha = 0.05\) to \(\alpha = \frac{0.05}{9} \approx 0.0056\)
since maintaining a significance level of \(\alpha = 0.05\) would
increase the experiment-wise error rate:
\(P(\text{Any False Positive}) = 1 - P(\text{No False Positives}) = 1 - 0.95^{9} \approx 0.3698\).
The table below shows the values of \(\beta_1\) that we obtained and the
corresponding p-values. Cultural dimensions for which the p-value is
lower than the corrected \(\alpha \approx 0.0056\) are indicated with
green shading.

\end{table}

As shown above, most of the \(\beta_1\) values obtained were negative,
including all three values that were significant at the
\(\alpha = 0.56\)\% significant level as calculated using the Bonferroni
correction. This means that, as the rating for the societal values of a
cultural dimension increase, the rating for the societal practices of
that cultural dimension actually decrease. In other words, rather than
being aligned, societal practices in fact run counter to societal
values.

While promising, there are a few issues with the data we have to
consider. First, the number of observations: 62 observations is a rather
small dataset, which suggest that any analysis will likely be limited.
Also, the data silences are important and should not be overlooked. Why
were certain countries not surveyed?
